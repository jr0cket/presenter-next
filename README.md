# Presenter-next

The idea behind presenter-next is to capture live feedback from the audience whilst giving a presentation.  The attendees of a talk can vote on the current slide, indicating whether the content is at the right pace or level desired.

The project is in two parts, with this project being the client-side webapp using [DevCards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards) library.

The server-side app can be found at: https://github.com/jr0cket/presenter-next-server

## Running the project 

To run the project, run the leiningen figwheel command:

```bash

```
